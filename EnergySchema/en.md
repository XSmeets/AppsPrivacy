# Privacy Policy
Effective Date: 21 March 2025

## 1. Introduction
Energy Schema ("the App") is developed by Xander Smeets ("the Developer"), an individual based in Veldhoven, The Netherlands. The Developer is committed to protecting user privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how the App handles data and ensures compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

## 2. Data Collection and Usage
The App does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data. It only accesses and stores files in its own format locally on the user's device. If users choose to store these files on a cloud service (e.g., iCloud), they may be transmitted and stored by that service according to its own privacy policy. However, the App itself does not transmit or share any data with the Developer or third parties.

Since no personal data is collected or processed, no legal basis under GDPR is required for data processing.

## 3. Data Security
The App does not process or transmit any personal data, meaning there are no risks related to data breaches or unauthorized access through the App itself. If users store files on a cloud service, that service's security policies and protections will apply.

## 4. Data Retention
The App does not impose any retention period on user files. Data remains under user control and is stored only on their device or any cloud service they choose to use.

## 5. User Rights
Under GDPR, individuals have rights such as access, rectification, and deletion of their personal data. However, as the App does not collect personal data, these rights do not apply in this context. If files are stored on a cloud service, users should refer to that serviceâ€™s privacy policy for information on exercising their rights.

## 6. Complaints and Regulatory Information
If users believe that their privacy rights have been violated, they have the right to lodge a complaint with their local Data Protection Authority (DPA), or the Dutch Data Protection Authority (Autoriteit Persoonsgegevens). The Dutch Data Protection Authority can be reached through:

> Autoriteit Persoonsgegevens\
> Website: [https://autoriteitpersoonsgegevens.nl](https://autoriteitpersoonsgegevens.nl)\
> Information on submitting complaints: [https://autoriteitpersoonsgegevens.nl/en/submitting-a-tip-off-or-a-complaint-to-the-dutch-dpa](https://autoriteitpersoonsgegevens.nl/en/submitting-a-tip-off-or-a-complaint-to-the-dutch-dpa)\
> Phone: [(+31) - (0)88 - 1805 250](tel:+31881805250)

## 7. Automated Decision-Making
The App does not use any form of automated decision-making or profiling.

## 8. Data Transfers Outside the EEA
The App does not transmit personal data outside the European Economic Area (EEA). If users store files on a cloud service, they should review that service's privacy policy to understand where their data may be stored.

## 9. Changes to This Policy
The Developer may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in practices. Any changes will be posted within the App or on the website.

## 10. Contact Information
